# CMake package configuration file for cachelib

# Defines the target "cachelib"
# Add this to your target_link_libraries() call to depend on cachelib.
#
# Also sets the variables CACHELIB_INCLUDE_DIR and CACHELIB_LIBRARIES.
# However, in most cases using the cachelib::cachelib target is sufficient,
# and you won't need these variables.
