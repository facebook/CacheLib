/**
 * Value History is a general cache consistency test. It tracks Get/Set/Delete
 * operation to one cache key and report user visible inconsistency if any.
 * Users have to ensure all Get, Set and Delete are logged like CacheWrapper
 * did.
 *
 * Value History chronologically inserts each operation begin and end into a
 * circular buffer. An operation could take effect in any time point between its
 * begin and end. But it must have taken effect after its end and haven't taken
 * effect before its begin. Particulary, if two operations overlap in time,
 * both values possible.
 *
 * Upon a cache hit (a Get end with not null value), Value History will check
 * whether the return value makes sense by looking into operation history. The
 * return value must be either 1) the value of the last operation which took
 * effect before this Get or 2) the values being set during this Get.
 *
 * We call case 1) as last value. There are multiple possible last values. For
 * example,
 *  Set Begin 1
 *  Set Begin 2
 *  Set End   1
 *  Set Begin 3
 *  Set End   3
 *  Set Begin 4
 *  Set End   2
 *  Get Begin
 *  Set End   4
 *  Set Begin 5
 *  Set End   5
 *  Get End   ?
 *
 * Both value 2 and 3 could be the last value to the Get. Although Set End 3 is
 * before Set Begin 4, Set End 4 is after Get Begin, thus value 3 still could be
 * the last value. Value 4 could belong to both case 1) and case 2), but we
 * count it towards case 2). Value 1 couldn't be the last value because Set End
 * 1 is before Set Begin 3, so it must be overridden by value 3.
 *
 * We call case 2) as inflight writes. Value 4 and Value 5 in the above example
 * are inflight writes.
 *
 * Formally, following is a recursive definition of "possible" value:
 *   - If SET is latest before GET and doesn't overlap with GET
 *        => SET is possible,
 *
 *   - If SET overlaps with GET
 *        => SET is possible,
 *
 *   - If SET[e] < SET'[b]
 *        => SET is NOT possible (no matter if SET' possible or not)
 *
 *   - If SET' is possible and SET overlaps with SET'
 *        => SET is possible
