// Checksum (and fused copy+checksum) helpers that can offload to Intel DSA
// via the DTO library when built with CACHELIB_BUILD_WITH_DTO. Without DTO
// support (or when DSA is unavailable at runtime), they run equivalent
// software implementations. In all cases the returned checksum is
// navy::checksum() (raw CRC-32C, seed 0) of @src, so offloaded and
// CPU-computed checksums verify against each other interchangeably.

// A single asynchronous checksum or fused copy+checksum operation.
// submit*() enqueues the operation on DSA and returns immediately (or runs
// it synchronously on the CPU when offload is unavailable); wait() completes
// it. While the accelerator works, wait() yields the calling fiber (when
// running on one, e.g. on a NavyThread) so other requests can execute on
// this thread — this is what makes the offload truly asynchronous. Off
// fibers it polls with a CPU pause.
//
// The object is not copyable or movable: the device holds a pointer into
// its storage while the operation is in flight. Each submit must be paired
// with exactly one wait() before reuse or destruction.
