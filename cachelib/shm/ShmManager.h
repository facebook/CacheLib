// Manages a list of shared memory segments associated with a given directory.
// If the directory is not present, one will be created and all segments will
// be created new from then on. If the directory exists and the metadata file
// exists in the directory, then segments can be attempted to be attached.
// Segments can be created new at any point of time as long as one by the same
// name is not already attached. Upon successful shutDown, the segments can be
// reattached by specifying the same directory for the next instance. If the
// directory is cleared after the segments are created, the segments are
// destroyed and cannot be reattached. The role of this class is also to take
// care of the key generation for the segments by using the segment's name.
// Once the segments are created, they can be mapped/attached by using
// the ShmSegment's api. Once attached successfully to a previous set of
// segments, new segments can also be created. This class is not thread safe.
// In general, the approach is to return an invalid value if there is an error
// that is possible to foresee and throw an exception if state of the instance
// could be corrupted
