# Experimental

Everything in this directory is under active development and subject to
change. You're free to try it out, but please do NOT use any of this in
production.

There is no guarantee that anything here will eventually make their way
into production-ready CacheLib. Features can be abruptly abandoned or
drastically changed without warning. Builds will NOT break but functionality
can and will break. If you need something from here for production, reach
out to the CacheLib team, and we could work something out.
