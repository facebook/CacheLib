/**
 * The compact cache is a highly memory-efficient way of mapping a key to a
 * value. It is implemented as an N-way associative hash table. This means that
 * each bucket in the hash table has room for at most N items. If the bucket
 * fills up, the least recently accessed item inside that bucket will be
 * evicted. The compact cache interface functions are all thread safe (i.e, they
 * do their own locking).
 *
 * The compact cache is a class template with a template parameter called a
 * CompactCacheDescriptor which defines the type of the keys and values and what
 * the compact cache can do with them. The CompactCacheDescriptor is a wrapper
 * around a Key and a ValueDescriptor. The Key defines the type of a key. The
 * ValueDescriptor defines the type of the value (if any), and how values can be
 * added together (needed in order to have the compact cache provide the add
 * operation).
 * Read ccache_descriptor.h for more information on value descriptor.
 *
 * The LRU mechanism withing a bucket is achieved by sliding the entries down
 * each time an entry is added on top of the bucket or each time an entry is
 * promoted because it was read. This compact cache is very efficient for small
 * values but can have bad performance when used with big values as each read
 * requires moving N big values.
