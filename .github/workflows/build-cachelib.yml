# NOTES:
# 1. While Github-Actions enables cache of dependencies,
#    Facebook's projects (folly,fizz,wangle,fbthrift)
#    are fast-moving targets - so we always checkout the latest version
#    (as opposed to using gitactions cache, which is recommended in the
#    documentation).
#
# 2. Using docker containers to build on CentOS and Debian,
#    Specifically CentOS v8.1.1911 as that
#    version is closest to Facebook's internal dev machines.
#
# 3. When using docker containers we install 'sudo',
#    as the docker images are typically very minimal and without
#    'sudo', while the ./contrib/ scripts use sudo.
#
# 4. When using the docker containers we install 'git'
#    BEFORE getting the CacheLib source code (with the 'checkout' action).
#    Otherwise, the 'checkout@v2' action script falls back to downloading
#    the git repository files only, without the ".git" directory.
#    We need the ".git" directory to updating the git-submodules
#    (folly/wangle/fizz/fbthrift). See:
#    https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/126#issuecomment-570288731
#
# 5. To reduce less-critical (and yet frequent) rebuilds, the jobs
#    check the author of the commit, and SKIP the build if
#    the author is "svcscm". These commits are automatic updates
#    for the folly/fbthrift git-submodules, and can happen several times a day.
#    While there is a possiblity that updating the git-submodules breaks
#    CacheLib, it is less likely, and will be detected once an actual
#    code change commit triggers a full build.
#    e.g. https://github.com/facebookincubator/CacheLib/commit/9372a82190dd71a6e2bcb668828cfed9d1bd25c1
#
# 6. The 'if' condition checking the author name of the commit (see #5 above)
#    uses github actions metadata variable:
#        'github.event.head_commit.author.name'
#    GitHub have changed in the past the metadata structure and broke
#    such conditions. If you need to debug the metadata values,
#    see the "dummy-show-github-event" job below.
#    E.g. https://github.blog/changelog/2019-10-16-changes-in-github-actions-push-event-payload/
#    As of Jan-2021, the output is:
#     {
#       "author": {
#          "email": "mimi@moo.moo",
#          "name": "mimi"
#       },
#       "committer": {
#         "email": "assafgordon@gmail.com",
#         "name": "Assaf Gordon",
#         "username": "agordon"
#        },
#       "distinct": true,
#       "id": "6c3aab0970f4a07cc2af7658756a6ef9d82f3276",
#       "message": "gitactions: test",
#       "timestamp": "2021-01-26T11:11:57-07:00",
#       "tree_id": "741cd1cb802df84362a51e5d01f28788845d08b7",

#     }
#
# 7. When checking the commit's author name, we use '...author.name',
#    NOT '...author.username' - because the 'svcscm' author does not
#    have a github username (see the 'mimi' example above).
