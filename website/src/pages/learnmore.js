	    CacheLib is a general purpose caching engine that
	    facilitates the easy development, scaling and maintenance
	    of high performing caches. CacheLib was designed by
	    drawing on experiences across a range of caching use cases
	    at Facebook.  From its first deployment in 2017, CacheLib
	    now powers over 70 services at Facebook including

	    <b> Facebookâ€™s CDN, social-graph cache, application look-aside
		cache, and block-storage system</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Large scale web service providers rely on caching to
	    deliver a great user experience. While web applications
	    commonly leverage remote look-aside caches, several other
	    applications need a local in-process cache because, either
	    they can not tolerate the RPC overhead of a common remote
	    cache, or require strict cache consistency, or need domain
	    specific cache features. These application teams often
	    build and maintain application specific, highly
	    specialized, local in-process caches. Without the ability
	    to share improvements among each other, this approach
	    leads to each team solving the hard problems of scaling
	    cache performance in isolation.
	</p>

	<p>
	    CacheLib is a thread-safe, scalable, C++ library that
	    provides the core caching functionality. It enables
	    services
	    <b>
		&nbsp;to customize and scale highly concurrent caches
		easily, and to leverage the improvements across different
		caching systems by using a simple, expressive, thread-safe
		API.</b> See <a href="../docs/"> docs </a> for more info.

	<h4>Features</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Efficient implementations of caching indexes, eviction policies
	    </li>

	    <li>
		Support for seamless hybrid caching (caches composed
		of DRAM and Flash) to achieve high hit ratios while
		caching large working sets. Relevant for content
		delivery cache use cases.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		Optimizations for high throughput, low memory, and low
		CPU usage for a broad range of workloads.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		Native implementations of arrays and hashmaps that can
		be cached and mutated efficiently without incurring
		any serialization overhead.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		Ability to perform application binary restarts and retain the state
		of the cache
	    </li>
