One of the challenges here is to ensure that we safely free the active allocations without any expensive synchronization. Since ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"CacheAllocator")," by itself does not have any synchronization, this is a little hard. The active allocation can be in any of the possible states :"),(0,i.mdx)("ol",null,(0,i.mdx)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Active allocation that is present in the ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"MMContainer")," or ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"AccessContainer"),"."),(0,i.mdx)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Active allocation that is not present in either but has active references held by user"),(0,i.mdx)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Active allocation that is present in one of these containers and in the process of being recycled."),(0,i.mdx)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Active allocation that is in the process of being freed to the allocator.")),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"Typically, when ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"CacheAllocator")," is dealing with an ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Item"),", it synchronizes access to the ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Item")," through the ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"MMContainer")," or ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"AccessContainer"),". We grab references to the Item upon these synchronization. During slab release, one possible option is to wait until all allocations get freed through some other regular cache process. But this could take a while. So the slab rebalancer tries to evict these active Items and free them manually. But, we need to ensure that we don't race with any other threads and double free any active allocations. To help with this across several states that the ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Item")," can be in, the rebalancing thread uses a special bit in the refcount to indicate that the ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Item")," is being moved. We set this bit conditionally when one of the other bits is set. This ensures that when the ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Item")," is in any valid state and we set this bit, it can not be freed by any other process. We also ensure that during the eviction, we don't touch Items that are in moving state. For these Items which have the moving bit set, the slab rebalancing thread then tries to remove them from the cache and wait for the refcounts to drop before calling free on them."),(0,i.mdx)("h3",{id:"pool-rebalancer"},"Pool rebalancer"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"The ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"PoolRebalancer")," is an asynchronous thread that rebalances the allocation of slabs to different allocation sizes within a pool. It uses a user provided RebalanceMetric to determine which allocation sizes need more memory and which ones don't and executes a slab release periodically when it makes sense to rebalance. Pools are rebalanced only after they have grown to their full sizes."),(0,i.mdx)("h3",{id:"pool-resizer"},"Pool resizer"),(0,i.mdx)("p",null,"The ",(0,i.mdx)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"PoolResizer")," ensures that the pools get sized down when they are over their limit. This typically happens when we size down a pool and the current size of the pool is more than its limit. The resizer watches for these pools and triggers a slab release from the pools that releases the slab back to the MemoryAllocator for use in other pools. This is asynchronous and pools slowly grow in size and shrink as the resizer works through the slabs."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
